# How It Works

1.  **Free Consultation**: A 30-minute phone or in-person meeting where you share your situation and we explain your options with zero pressure.
2.  **Case Strategy**: We develop a custom legal strategy built around your goals, your children's needs, and your financial reality.
3.  **Negotiation or Litigation**: We pursue the best outcome — through settlement when possible, through the courtroom when necessary.
4.  **Resolution & Beyond**: We see your case to completion and remain available for future modifications or enforcement needs.
