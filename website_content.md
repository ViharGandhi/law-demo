## FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)
**Q: How much does a divorce cost in Texas?**
A: Costs vary widely — an uncontested divorce can be as low as $1,500–$3,000 in flat fees, while contested divorces with litigation can range from $10,000 to $30,000+. We offer a free consultation to give you a realistic estimate.

**Q: How is child custody decided in Texas?**
A: Texas courts prioritize the best interest of the child. Factors include each parent's relationship with the child, stability of home environment, and the child's own preferences if they are 12 or older.

**Q: Is Texas a 50/50 divorce state?**
A: Texas is a community property state, meaning marital assets are generally split equitably — but not always exactly 50/50. The court considers multiple factors.

**Q: How long does a divorce take in Texas?**
A: There is a mandatory 60-day waiting period. Uncontested divorces often finalize in 90–120 days. Contested cases can take 12–18 months or longer.

**Q: Can I modify a custody order?**
A: Yes, if there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the original order was issued.
